// Create a program where you can initialize different types of animals
// All animals have:
//   - quantity of legs,
//   - color,
//   - quantity of eyes,
//   - quantity of ears,
//   - age.
//   - animal group.
// All animals can:
//   - make a sound when they are away
//   - make a sound when they are asleep: ALL animals make the same sound when being asleep

// Animal groups can be reptiles, birds, mammals, etc. Animals from an animal group have specific attributes and
// behaviour to that animal. For example birds can fly.

// Design a program where you can initialize different animals. You need at least three animal groups
// and one animal for each group. Create an example main to show the program functionality.
// Example: Birds, Reptiles and Mammals with respective Eagle, Anaconda and Dog.
